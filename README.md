# Intro To Graphs

## Basics

Often represented by Vertices (dots).

Connected by Edges (lines)

We can assign weight to edges and vertices.

Adding direction between dots may be important, we can do so by adding directions/edges. If one edge is directed, all need to be directed. If none are directed, they can all be so.

We can add weight to edges. Similar in concept to vectors.

The length of all of the edges does not matter. As long as the edges link the same vertices, it is equal. They will represent the same exact graph.

## Facebook Example

Vertices: Facebook Users (typically represent the data)
Edges: Friendship relationship (or lack thereof), connect User A and B if A&B are friends.
